# Welcome to the microwavebot website!
Welcome user! this is the repo for my [website (click here)](https://microwavebot.tech), there are currently only two devs who are working on this repo soon I will be making an entire team for the website so that we can further increase development and productivity.

# Our Team

# Our To-Do List
